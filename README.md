# Fancy-Frontend
First Attempt at making a Responsive Website that will help with experience and portfolio building

## For GitHub Pages
```cmd
ng build --prod --base-href "fancy-frontend"

npx angular-cli-ghpages --dir=dist/fancy-frontend
```

TODO: 
    ## Master Task: Finish Styling The Homepage
        - extract some css elements into their own styles file
            - basic geometry and such
        - think and restructure current home-page architecture for scalability
        - Possibly Mock up some design ideas for the whole page
        - do some animation research on some engaging animations
        - research navbar functionality
            - I want the navbar to take up the whole screen and the only way it can be left is if the user clicks the x
                - currently its limited in size and the user can scroll out of the navbar

        ** fix buggy navbar Profile and About hero text
