# Fancy-Frontend
First Attempt at making a Responsive Website that will help with experience and portfolio building

TODO: 
    - Master: finish styling the homepage
        - extract some css elements into their own styles file
            - basic geometry and such
        - think and restructure current home-page architecture for scalability
        - Possibly Mock up some design ideas for the whole page
        - do some animation research on some engaging animations
        - research navbar functionality
            - I want the navbar to take up the whole screen and the only way it can be left is if the user clicks the x
                - currently its limited in size and the user can scroll out of the navbar
